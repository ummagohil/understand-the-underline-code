// Currently, no global types are defined here as component-specific types are co-located.
// This file can be used if shared types across multiple distinct modules emerge.

// Example of a shared type if needed:
// export interface UserProfile {
//   id: string;
//   name: string;
//   email: string;
// }

export {}; // Ensures this file is treated as a module.
